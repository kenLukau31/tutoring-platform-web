# Tutoring Platform – Web Project 📚

## About the Project
This project consists of the **design and development of a tutoring platform** that connects students with independent tutors in a simple, transparent, and flexible way.

The platform does not represent any specific institution. Instead, it works as a **neutral meeting point** where tutors operate autonomously, offering personalized lessons according to their experience and teaching methods.

This was an early web development project focused on **user experience**, **interface clarity**, and **basic interaction logic**.
